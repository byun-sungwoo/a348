There are many ways to keep processes running in the background and I
personally use tmux, but I think the 'screen' command is more than enough.

# When out of a session
screen -ls		// list out current sessions

screen			// start new session, this generates a random number as the session name
screen -r 19102		// reattach to session 19102

screen -S hello		// start new session called hello
screen -r hello		// reattach to session hello

# When in a session
C-a + C+d		// detach from session
C+d			// kill current session
